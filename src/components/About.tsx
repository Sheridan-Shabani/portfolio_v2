                Welcome to my world, that of Sheridan SHABANI, your computer prodigy. At 24, I am currently an apprentice engineer at CESI in Arras, but don't be fooled.
                I am doing my apprenticeship at Médiamétrie in Amiens as a junior systems engineer. During my school and work experiences, I have tackled projects in all sorts of fields, from computer systems to development and networking, and more. I am like a Swiss Army knife in IT, able to adapt to any situation.
                I didn't get where I am today by accident. I've had my fair share of struggles along the way, but I've always believed that with a little determination, anything is possible. Moreover, it is these struggles that have made me the person I am today.
                My journey started as a trainee in a computer shop, but I worked my way up and now I'm living my dream as a junior systems engineer. And let me tell you, I'm not afraid to take on responsibility. I've always set high limits for myself to keep growing and learning.
                So if you're looking for an IT whiz who isn't afraid to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty, look no further.
